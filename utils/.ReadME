<!-- Great! On macOS, you can follow these steps to run your Django project within a virtual environment:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate the active virtual environment.

3. **Install Django:**
   While the virtual environment is active, install Django using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Run Migrations:**
   Navigate to your Django project's root directory (where `manage.py` is located) and run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a Django App:**
   Now, you can try creating the `backend` app again:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp backend
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default. Open this URL in your web browser to see the Django welcome page.

Remember to activate the virtual environment whenever you work on your project, and deactivate it when you're done:
```bash
deactivate
```
